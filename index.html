      It's That Man Again (ITMA) was a radio comedy programme that was broadcast
      by the BBC for twelve series from 1939 to 1949, featuring Tommy Handley in
      the central role. ITMA was a character-driven comedy whose satirical
      targets included officialdom and the proliferation of minor wartime
      regulations. Parts of the scripts were rewritten in the hours before the
      broadcast, to ensure topicality. ITMA was an important contributor to
      British morale during the war, with its cheerful take on the day-to-day
      preoccupations of the public, but its detailed topicality—one of its
      greatest attractions at the time—has prevented it from wearing well on
      repeated hearing. Handley died during the twelfth series, the remaining
      programmes of which were immediately cancelled: ITMA could not work
      without him, and no further series were commissioned. ITMA's innovative
      structure was successfully continued in comedy shows of the 1950s and
      1960s, such as Take It from Here, The Goon Show and Round the Horne. (Full
